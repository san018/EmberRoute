## no-unbound

`{{unbound}}` is a legacy hold over from the days in which Ember's template engine was less performant. It's use today
is vestigial, and it no longer offers performance benefits.

This rule **forbids** the following:

```hbs
{{unbound aVar}}
```

And

```hbs
{{a-thing foo=(unbound aVar)}}
```
