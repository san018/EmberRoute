## block-indentation

Good indentation is crucial for long term maintenance of templates. For example, having blocks misaligned is a common cause of logic errors...

This rule **forbids** the following:

``` hbs
  {{#each foo as |bar}}

    {{/each}}

  <div>
  <p>{{t "greeting"}}</p>
  </div>
```

``` html
<div>
  <p>{{t 'Stuff here!'}}</p></div>
```

### Configuration

The following values are valid configuration:

  * boolean -- `true` indicates a 2 space indent, `false` indicates that the rule is disabled.
  * numeric -- the number of spaces to require for indentation
  * "tab" -- To indicate tab style indentation (1 char)
