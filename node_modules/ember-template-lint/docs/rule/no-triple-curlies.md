## no-triple-curlies

Usage of triple curly braces to allow raw HTML to be injected into the DOM is large vector for exploits of your application (especially when the raw HTML is user controllable ). Instead of using `{{{foo}}}`, you should use appropriate helpers or computed properties that return a `SafeString` (via `Ember.String.htmlSafe` generally) and ensure that user supplied data is properly escaped.

This rule **forbids** the following:

``` hbs
{{{foo}}}
```
