## no-html-comments

HTML comments in your templates will get compiled and rendered into the DOM at runtime. Instead you can annotate your templates using Handlebars comments, which will be stripped out when the template is compiled and have no effect at runtime.

This rule **forbids** the following:

``` hbs
<!-- comment goes here -->
```

This rule **allows** the following:

```hbs
{{!-- comment goes here --}}
```
